Analyzing Weather Data in preparation for opening a store in Oahu, HI to determine if the location is sustainable year-round.

## Overview
A potential investor wants temperature averages for the months of June and December to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is a good venture.  Data was taken for the months of June and December over a seven-year period (from 2010 through 2016) to determine highs, lows, and averages for the two requested months.

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed
* June Findings:
From the data collected, we can see that there are very few instances of weather dipping below seventy degrees, with the majority hovering around 75° and up into the low 80s.  This is a great result for a potential business as the weather won't be prohibitively cold or too hot for potential customers.

* December Findings:
While December shows a lower median of 71° and rarely reaches higher temperatures of 80°, the weather is still extremely temperate and shows very little data dropping below the low 60s.  For many tourists, this is still considered balmy weather for winter and once again, will not be a prohibitive factor in opening a shop in Oahu.

* Major Differences:
The only variables that may have an impact on day-to-day business lies in the wider variance of highs and lows between the two months.  June has a variance of 21 degrees, ranging from 64° to 85°, while December has a wider margin of 27 degrees, ranging from 56° to 83°.  That day to day inconsistency would have to be carefully planned for in terms of purchasing perishables for resale and staff scheduling.

## Summary
The initial results speak well to opening a shop in Oahu and don’t raise concerns in terms of the temperature being a factor.  While December is cooler, the highs aren’t too much lower than in June and the island gets enough tourists that the cooler weather is still much higher than other locations in the northern hemisphere.  It would be prudent to look at precipitation patterns as that is another major factor in how many customers might decide to stay indoors, despite the warm temperatures.  Humidity is another factor to consider and would be good to investigate into.  And to get a better understanding of the sustainability of such a business, it would be wise to explore these three weather factors for the full twelve months instead of just a sampling of two.  As island weather can be different from mainland weather, it’s best not to assume that June and December are the most extreme weather points of highs and lows to use as a final determination.
